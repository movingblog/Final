1. Hire a moving company.
Planning (where do i start), like every other thing is the first step in making your move much easier. you can look up a number of moving companies on the web or white pages but finding the right moving company may also be tricky as i found out myself.

1. They help you plan ahead.
Ever heard the popular saying by Benjamin franklin “Failing to plan is planning to fail”. yeah it applies to moving as well. you need to plan how your move would take place. the best time to move- yes!, while at packmyload.com we let you decide on what time and day you want to do your move, we also try to look at your schedule and offer advice on if that is the best time to do it. 
By hiring a moving company they will sort everything out for you, just agree on a date and let them handle things.

2. The Safer option
When moving, the safety of your personal effects while packing and during transit can be a source of concern and worry. it is important to have the right type of truck and packing materials to help you secure your belongings to its final destination from the process of packing to unloading and offloading.
You may not have thought this through, but do you know how many boxes are required to pack all that you own? A number of moving companies require you to make an estimation of your belongings before the move. 
packmyload.com has developed a mobile application that helps you take a photo of your personal effects before your move, eliminating the need for a physical visit to plan your move. how cool is that? 😎.

3. They help you save time and money.
Frankly as a busy professional myself, we do not want to worry much and spend too much time overthinking about what might or might not occur while planning and executing a move. Hiring a professional moving company helps you save valuable time, they look at your situation and easily come up with a solution to everything. and yess they also saves you lots of money. yeah you might think that hiring a moving company is an expensive service. but its nothing compared to the safety and security you get from the damages you can incure when you do it yourself. 
Full service moving companies like packmyload.com offer moving insurance for all your moves which means that they take full responsibility for any damages that may occur while your belongings are in their care.
