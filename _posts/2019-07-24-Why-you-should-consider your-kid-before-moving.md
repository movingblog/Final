Due to the stresses, the long list of responsibilities and tiredness we, as parents, go through when planning for and going through a move, it may be simple to overlook what our kids could be going through.  Here is a list of important things for your school-age kids to consider making this significant move as stress-free as possible.

**Social / Emotional Considerations**

Any kind of change can be particularly frightening for kids, and it is normal for kids of school age to magnify in their minds anything that is even mildly fear-producing.  Therefore, kids are often affected by a move even more than their parents even though they may not express or manifest outwardly their amount of stress or worries.

Some of the worries and feelings that your kids might encounter during a move include:

<div class="listing-features fl-wrap">
  <ul>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> A feeling of insecurity and fear about making new friends, or being accepted or liked at the new school.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> Academic concerns about changing teachers and schools and finding fresh curricula and norms.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> A sense of loss in abandoning present friends, educators and even their present home.
</li>
     <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Additional fear should be associated with life-changing occurrences such as divorce, change-of-job for a parent, family economic changes, etc.</li>  
  </ul>
</div>



Children mask their fears, concerns, anxiety or even depression more often than adults, sometimes because they are unaware of their underlying emotions or don't want to burden their parents.

So what can you do as a parent to help make sure your kids are going through the move with as little stress as possible?

Be conscious of just how much the move could affect your kids and ensure they speak about their emotions and issues. Do this in a calm and nurturing setting. Maybe plan a "unique" meal with your favourite dishes and lead a family conversation. Share one of your thoughts or issues with them. But then inform them how you worked this out. This will allow you to draw their emotions out and then assist them through their concerns. They will often be tremendously pleased.

Make the move fun and give them a sense of control by letting them do some planning with you. For example, you can go online together to check out the location of the library closest to your new home, or the closest bicycle shop or specialty stores they like, or the nearby restaurants or sports clubs they might like to participate in. Then create a point of placing on your moving calendar a moment that you can go over with your kids (if you're moving to someone near enough) to look over the fresh locations. If you let your kids feel they're part of the moving process, they'll also feel more excited about the experience. Take them to the new house or display them photos of the new house and invite them to engage in the decoration phase. Ask them what colour they'd like most for their new bedroom.

Create extra moments of family bonding during the move. Try to sneak into a family game night just before or after the move, go out to the movies, turn the moving boxes into a fort, or turn the packing process into some sort of game, as tired as the grown-ups might be. It's nice for them to combine the process of moving with something happy and celebratory.

**Practical Considerations**

Make sure you have done all the preparatory work necessary to ensure that your children make a transition to their new schools as seamless as possible. If appropriate, find out the new school's summer reading or summer homework.

Speak to the current teachers of your children to determine whether there is any information that would be important to impart to the new teachers of your children about their strengths, needs or preferences. Talk to the new school and, if possible, the new teachers to see if your kids need to do any catch-up work so that they are on par with the other kids. Provide them with whatever tutoring or help they need, if necessary, so that they can be optimally successful and happy at the new school.

Do everything you can to make sure your kids can make friends rapidly. Look at enrolling them in nearby after-school courses or sports. If you are attending a worship house, look into classes and activities that your kids might appreciate. Try to meet the parents of the new classmates of your kids and set up after school play dates.

Planning for the big day of the move is critical. Here are more tips to plan your move. Here are a few other things to consider:

<div class="listing-features fl-wrap">
  <ul>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> It's best to have your kids stay with a grandparent, family member or trusted good friend on an actual day if someone's nearby. This will keep them secure and happy.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> Prepare plenty of food and drink in advance. The food should be as non-perishable and simple to consume as possible. Include some of the favourite foods and treatments of your children in your ice chest to maintain them healthy.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Prepare toys, games and books in advance to maintain your kids entertained during the lengthy moving period.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Your kids will want to have a nap or relax during the process. It's a good idea to leave a blanket, pillow, or other comfort items (maybe their favorite toy) that they have access to during the day.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>It's important to have a box of things you might need in a hurry. Make sure this box stays in a safe area during the move (the bathtub is a great place to keep important items that stay with you and don't go on the moving vehicle). These products should include medication, band-aids, favorite books for your kids, toiletries, and other private things.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Since the front door of your old and new homes will be open during the move, make sure your kids are protected and stay inside the house.</li>
    <li style="width:100%"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Children often want to play with the moving dollies (pushcarts) and cartons that are in the home during the move. Moving boxes can be a excellent source of fun for kids, but if your little one comes inside, they can be unsafe with little kids. And attempts to hurry the race on a dolly can also be dangerous. Be sure to supervise the use of moving materials by your kids during a move.</li>
